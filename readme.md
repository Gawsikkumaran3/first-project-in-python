## Logic

You are going to make the tea System
in Python using if-else statement

in which you take inputs following inputs:
- Milk
- Tea
- Water
- Pan
- Fire
- Stove

### Pesudo Code

    milk_have = input(Do you have milk..Yes/No?)
    tea = input(Do you have Tea..Yes/No?)
    water = input(Do you have water..Yes/No?)
    Pan = input(Do you have Pan..Yes/No?)
    Fire = input(Do you have Fire..Yes/No?)
    Stove = input(Do you have Stove..Yes/No?)   
    Sugar = input(Do you have Sugar..Yes/No?)

    if milk == "Yes" or "yes":
        if tea == "Yes" or "yes":
            if water == "Yes" or "yes":
                if Pan == "Yes" or "yes":
                    if Fire == "Yes" or "yes":
                        if Stove "Yes" or "yes":
                            if Sugar "Yes" or "yes":
                                print("Hurrah You can make tea.. Enjoy)
                            
                            else:
                        else:
                    else:
                else:
            else:
        else:
