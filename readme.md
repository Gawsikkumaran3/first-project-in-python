You are going to make the tea System
in Python using if-else statement

in which you take inputs following inputs:
- Milk
- Tea

- Stove
- Sugar

### Variables to be declared

- track_products
- water_added
- tea_added
- milk_added
- fire_added
- stove_added
- pan_added
- sugar_added

### Pseudo Code

    loop(runs till the program ends):

        if product_added == no
            product = input(Do you have water..Yes/No?)
        if product == yes
            product_added = yes
            track_counter.append(value)
        if product_added = yes and value in track_counter:
            pass for all the products
            print ("Hurrah! Here is your tea , you can taste and enjoy it!") #if all the products are available

        elif product = no
            product_added = input("Is the product added ? Yes/No ")
            if product_added = no
                confirmation = input("Do you want to continue making tea ? Yes/No ")
                if confirmation == yes
                    pass
                elif confirmation == no
                    quit()
                else
                    Enter a valid input - Yes/No
            elif product_added = yes
                track_products.append(value)
				break	
            else
                Enter a valid input - Yes/No
        else
                Enter a valid input - Yes/No
